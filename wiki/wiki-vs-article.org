** What is an article?
   Given that this wiki will sort of be a catch all for my literary content at
   the moment, I want to dinstiguish between two different types of documents I
   plan to populate this wiki with. The general nondescript purview of the word
   article motivates me to disambiguate between two different definitions of the
   word that will be employed here.

   Did I need to overload a single word to refer to my documents? No; I could
   always have chosen to distinct lexemes to properly preclude any
   equivocation. But sometimes the heart wants what it wants :(.

*** Wiki Article
    You probably know what a wiki is if you're here. Entries on a wiki, such as
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page][Wikipedia]] are colloquially known as articles
