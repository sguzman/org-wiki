#+title: Mathematics
* Introduction
The viability of mathematics to offer solutions to engineering problems should
be beyond dispute by now. But beyond that, math is beautiful.

* Fields
As with all intellectual ventures, math is best understood in terms of its
constituent parts and the relationships thereof. Here are a few fields that have
received a prodigious amount of historical development.
